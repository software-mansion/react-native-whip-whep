- [iOS](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-whip-whep/tree/main/packages/ios-client)

For documentation and examples of usage, check out the [examples](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-whip-whep/tree/main/examples) folder. It contains simple apps showing the usage and providing some documentation for each platform.

A WHIP/WHEP server is necessary in order to use the SDKs. We recommend [ex-webrtc](https://github.com/elixir-webrtc/ex_webrtc/tree/master/examples/whip_whep) server as it was used during development and testing.
