# WHIP/WHEP android-client

An implementation of WHIP and WHEP protocols for Android. Provides basic methods for establishing a connection in order to stream or receive media.

## Components

The repository consists of 7 main components:

- `WhepClient` - a class that handles WHEP connection and receiving media stream,
- `WhipClient` - a class that handles WHIP connection and sending media stream,
- `ClientBase` - provides methods that are shared by both players,
- `ConfigurationOptions` - a structure that holds optional initial connection configuration options, like STUN server URL, authorization token or stream limitations, for example sending only audio or video track,
- `Errors` - contains all the errors that can be thrown by the package,
- `SuspendableSdpObserver` - implements the SdpObserver interface used by the WebRTC library,
- `VideoView` - provides a basic view for WHIP camera/WHEP player.

## Examples

The `examples/android` folder provides an example app that allows to stream media using phone's default video and audio devices and receive remote stream.

## Usage

In order to use the package functionalities and run the example app, a WHIP/WHEP server is necessary. It is recommended to use the [WHIP/WHEP server](https://github.com/elixir-webrtc/ex_webrtc/tree/9e1888185211c8da7128db7309584af8e863fafa/examples/whip_whep) provided by `elixir-webrtc`, as it was utilized during the development.
