# iOSExample

A simple example app showing the main functionalities of the WHIP/WHEP package. It consists of a view that, depending of whether WHIP or WHEP has been chosen, shows a camera preview or current media stream.

## Initial configuration

As stated in the package README file, for the server it is recommended to use the [ex_webrtc](https://github.com/elixir-webrtc/ex_webrtc/tree/9e1888185211c8da7128db7309584af8e863fafa/examples/whip_whep) server, as it is simple, easy to use and it was used during the package development. In order to run the server:
- Clone the `ex_webrtc` repo
- In the folder `examples/whip_whep/config` modify the file `config.exs` to use your IP address:
  ```
  config :whip_whep,
  ip: <your IP address>,
  port: 8829,
  token: "example"
  ```
- From the `whip_whep` folder run commands `mix deps.get` and `mix run --no-halt` (running the commands requires Elixir installed on your device, for example using `brew install elixir`)

To see the stream from your device, enter `http://<your IP address>:8829/index.html`. These instructions are available in the `ex_webrtc` repo as well.

The server URLs are saved to environment variables. To use them, it is necessary to modify template file `ServerSettings.xcconfig` with your URLs.
When the URLs are defined, it is required to edit the `Info.plist` file, either through text editor:
```
<key>WhepServerUrl</key>
<string>$(WHEP_SERVER_URL)</string>
<key>WhipServerUrl</key>
<string>$(WHIP_SERVER_URL)</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This application requires camera access to gather information about available video devices.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This application requires microphone access to gather information about available audio devices.</string>
```

or directly using Xcode:

The created configuration has to be added to target. After clicking on the `iOSExample` name in the project navigator on the left side of the editor window, there appears a `Info` tab with a `Configurations` section. The created `ServerSettings.xcconfig` file has to be added to both debug and release configurations:

## WHEP

In order to initialize a player, an instance of a `WhepClientPlayer` has to be created using a server URL. One can provide here some optional configuration, such as authorization token or STUN server address if necessary.

```swift
var whepPlayer = WhepClientPlayer(serverUrl: URL(string: "http://\(Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["WhepServerUrl"] as? String ?? "")")!)
```

After creating a player, all that has to be done is to invoke the `connect` method:

```swift
do {
    try await whepPlayer.connect()
} catch is SessionNetworkError {
    print("Session Network Error")
}
```

And display the stream, using `RTCMTLVideoView`:

```swift
if let videoTrack = whepPlayer.videoTrack {
    WebRTCVideoView(videoTrack: videoTrack)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
}
```

## WHIP 

To initialize a WHIP player, `audioDevice` and `videoDevice` should also be passed to `WhipClientPlayer` constructor, as it has to be specified which devices will be used for the stream. Here, the default ones have been used. Remember to also check for the access to the camera and microphone, and request it and grant it if necessary.

```swift
var whipPlayer = WhipClientPlayer(serverUrl: URL(string: "http://\(Bundle.main.infoDictionary?["WhipServerUrl"] as? String ?? "")")!, audioDevice: AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .audio), videoDevice: AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video))
```

For the connection, the flow is the same as for the WHEP player:
```swift
do {
    try await whipPlayer.connect()
} catch is SessionNetworkError {
    print("Session Network Error")
}
```
